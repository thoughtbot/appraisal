Feature: run a rake task through several appraisals

  Background:
    Given a directory named "projecto"
    And the following installed dummy gems:
      | name       | version |
      | dummy_girl | 1.3.0   |
      | dummy_girl | 1.3.2   |
      | dummy_rake | 0.8.7   |
      | dummy_rake | 0.9.0   |
      | dummy_sass | 3.1.0   |
      | dummy_spec | 3.1.9   |
    When I cd to "projecto"
    And I write to "Gemfile" with:
    """
    gem "dummy_rake", "0.8.7"
    gem "dummy_girl"

    group :assets do
      gem 'dummy_sass', "~> 3.1.0"
    end

    group :test, :development do
      gem 'dummy_spec', "~> 3.1.0"
    end
    """
    When I add "appraisal" from this project as a dependency
    And I write to "Appraisals" with:
    """
    appraise "1.3.2" do
      gem "dummy_girl", "1.3.2"
    end

    appraise "1.3.0" do
      gem "dummy_girl", "1.3.0"
      gem "dummy_rake", "0.9.0"
    end
    """
    When I write to "Rakefile" with:

    task :default => :version
    """
    When I successfully run `bundle install --local`
    And I successfully run `bundle exec rake appraisal:install --trace`

  Scenario: run a specific task with one appraisal
    When I successfully run `bundle exec rake appraisal:1.3.0 version --trace`
    Then the output should contain "Loaded 1.3.0"

  Scenario: run a specific task with all appraisals
    When I successfully run `bundle exec rake appraisal version --trace`
    Then the output should contain "Loaded 1.3.0"
    And the output should contain "Loaded 1.3.2"
    And the output should not contain "Invoke version"

  Scenario: run the default task with one appraisal
    When I successfully run `bundle exec rake appraisal:1.3.0 --trace`
    Then the output should contain "Loaded 1.3.0"

  Scenario: run the default task with all appraisals
    When I successfully run `bundle exec rake appraisal --trace`
    Then the output should contain "Loaded 1.3.0"
    And the output should contain "Loaded 1.3.2"

  Scenario: run a failing task with one appraisal
    When I run `bundle exec rake appraisal:1.3.0 fail --trace`
    Then the output should contain "Fail 1.3.0"
    And the exit status should be 1

  Scenario: run a failing task with all appraisals
    When I run `bundle exec rake appraisal fail --trace`
    Then the output should contain "Fail 1.3.2"
    But the output should not contain "Fail 1.3.0"
    And the exit status should be 1

  Scenario: run a cleanup task
    When I run `bundle exec rake appraisal:cleanup --trace`
    Then a file named "gemfiles/1.3.0.gemfile" should not exist
    And a file named "gemfiles/1.3.0.gemfile.lock" should not exist
    And a file named "gemfiles/1.3.2.gemfile" should not exist
    And a file named "gemfiles/1.3.2.gemfile.lock" should not exist

  Scenario: run a relativize task
    When I add a relative path to "gemfiles/1.3.0.gemfile.lock"
    And I run `bundle exec rake appraisal:relativize --trace`
    Then the exit status should be 0
    And the file "gemfiles/1.3.0.gemfile.lock" should only include relative paths

  Scenario: install gems within groups
    Then the file "gemfiles/1.3.0.gemfile" should contain:
      """
      group :assets do
        gem "dummy_sass", "~> 3.1.0"
      end
      """
